# MATH304 Final Project â€“ Movement Decoding from EEG (MATLAB)

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in MATLAB to classify intended left vs. right hand movements based on brain signals (EEG). Developed as part of MATH 304: Numerical Analysis and Optimization at Duke Kunshan University.

## Overview

- **Input**: 204-feature EEG data from .mat files (`Data.mat`, `Sensors.mat`)
- **Method**: Barrier method for constrained optimization, using:
  - Newton's method for subproblems
  - Backtracking line search
- **Evaluation**: 6-fold cross-validation
- **Tools used**: Custom MATLAB scripts

Despite challenges with ill-conditioned Hessians, the project explores the use of second-order methods and potential improvements like L-BFGS.
